<B>const directsound.DSBCAPS_GETCURRENTPOSITION2;</B><P>

Indicates that IDirectSoundBuffer::GetCurrentPosition should use 

the new behavior of the play cursor. In DirectSound in DirectX 1, the play cursor was significantly ahead of the 

actual playing sound on emulated sound cards; it was directly behind the write cursor. Now, if the 

DSBCAPS_GETCURRENTPOSITION2 flag is specified, the application can get a more accurate play position. If this 

flag is not specified, the old behavior is preserved for compatibility. Note that this flag affects only emulated 

sound cards; if a DirectSound driver is present, the play cursor is accurate for DirectSound in all versions of 

DirectX.<P>
