MAPI should not inform the MAPI spooler of the session's existence. The result is that no messages can be sent or received within the session except through a tightly coupled store and transport pair. A calling client sets this flag if it is acting as an agent, if configuration work must be done, or if the client is browsing the available message stores.<P>
