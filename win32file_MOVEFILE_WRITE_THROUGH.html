Windows NT only: The function does not return until the file has actually been moved on the disk. Setting this flag guarantees that a move perfomed as a copy and delete operation is flushed to disk before the function returns. The flush occurs at the end of the copy operation.<BR>This flag has no effect if the MOVEFILE_DELAY_UNTIL_REBOOT flag is set.<P>
