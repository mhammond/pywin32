Apart from the error handling semantics, this is equivalent 

to <A HREF="pythoncom__CoInitializeEx_meth.html">pythoncom::CoInitializeEx</A>(pythoncom.COINIT_APARTMENTTHREADED). 

See <A HREF="pythoncom__CoInitializeEx_meth.html">pythoncom::CoInitializeEx</A> for a description.<P>

<H3>Return Value</H3>This function will ignore the RPC_E_CHANGED_MODE error, as 

that error indicates someone else beat you to the initialization, and 

did so with a different threading model.  This error is ignored as it 

still means COM is ready for use on this thread, and as this function 

does not explicitly specify a threading model the caller probably 

doesn't care what model it is. 

<BR>All other COM errors will raise pythoncom.error as usual.  Use 

<A HREF="pythoncom__CoInitializeEx_meth.html">pythoncom::CoInitializeEx</A> if you also want to handle the RPC_E_CHANGED_MODE 

error.<P>
