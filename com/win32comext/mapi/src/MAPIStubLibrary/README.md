# MAPIStubLibrary

The MAPI Stub Library is a drop in replacement for mapi32.lib which supports building both 32 and 64 bit MAPI applications. This library eliminates the need to explicitly link to MAPI.

**See the [documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/cc963763.aspx) for information on building the MAPI Stub Library and integrating it into your project.**
**See the [FAQ](https://mapistublibrary.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=FAQ) for questions about this library, such as when and why to use it.**

These MAPI headers were downloaded from <https://github.com/microsoft/MAPIStubLibrary/commit/5183a5f18c388a1b964662fa48bb0f08592fc4b8> and enable us to build the MAPI extension.
