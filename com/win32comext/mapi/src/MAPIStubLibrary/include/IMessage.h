/*	OpenIMsgOnIStg - Main entry point
 *
 *	NOTE 1:  The IStg must be opened with STGM_TRANSACTED if STGM_READWRITE
 *	is specified.  Since messages don't support a write only mode, IMessage
 *	doesn't allow a storage object opened in write only mode. If the storage
 *	is opened STGM_READ, then STGM_TRANSACTED is NOT required.
 *
 *	NOTE 2:  The lpMapiSup parameter is optional.  If supplied then IMessage
 *	will support the MAPI_DIALOG and ATTACH_DIALOG flags (by calling
 *	support method: DoMCDialog) on CopyTo and DeleteAttach methods.
 *	If lpMapiSup is not supplied (i.e. passed 0) then dialog flags will be
 *	ignored.  If supplied then ModifyRecipients will attempt to convert
 *	short term entryids to long term entryids (by calling support method
 *	OpenAddressBook and calls on the returned object).  If not supplied
 *	then short term entryid's will be stored without conversion.
 *
 *	NOTE 3:  The lpfMsgCallRelease parameter is optional.  If supplied then
 *	IMessage will call the routine when the last release on (the toplevel only)
 *	message is called.  It is intended to allow the callee to free the IStorage
 *	that contains the message.  IMessage will not use the IStorage object after
 *	making this call.
 *
 *	NOTE 4:  Behavior of multiple opens of sub-objects (Attachments, Streams,
 *	Storages, Messages, etc.) within a message is deliberately undefined in
 *	MAPI.  This implementation allows them, but will do it by AddRef'ing the
 *	existing open and returning it to the caller of OpenAttachment or
 *	OpenProperty.  This means that whatever access mode the first open on a
 *	specific Attachment or Property had is what all others will get regardless
 *	of what the subsequent opens asked for.
 *
 *	NOTE 5:  There is currently one flag defined for use with the ulFlags
 *	parameter. The IMSG_NO_ISTG_COMMIT flag controls whether the commit
 *	method of IStorage is called when the client calls SaveChanges on the
 *	IMessage object. Some clients of IMessage may wish to commit the IStorage
 *	themselves after writing additional data to the storage (beyond what
 *	IMessage itself writes). To aid in this, the IMessage implementation
 *	guarantees to name all sub-storages starting with "__". Therefore,
 *	if the client keeps its names out of that namespace, there will be no
 *	accidental collisions.
 *
 *	WARNING:
 *
 *	This implementation of IMessage will support OpenProperty w/MAPI_CREATE
 *	where the source interface is IID_IStorage if the property id is
 *	'PR_ATTACH_DATA'.  Once this has been done, the caller has an IStorage
 *	interface on this property.  This is ok and should allow for
 *	easier implementation of OLE 2.0 Server functionality.  However, if you
 *	pass in the new IStorage ptr (to the attachment data) through the
 *	OpenIMsgOnIStg entry point and then proceed to release things in the
 *	wrong order we will make no attempt to behave in a predictable fashion.
 *	Keep in mind that the correct method for placing a message into an
 *	attachment is to call OpenProperty where the source interface is
 *	IID_IMessage.  The IStorage interface is supported to allow an easy way
 *	to stick a WWord doc. into an attachment w/o converting to/from IStream.
