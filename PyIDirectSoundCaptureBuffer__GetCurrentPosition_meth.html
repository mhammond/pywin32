<B>GetCurrentPosition(</B>)<P>Returns a tuple of the current capture and read position in 

the buffer. The capture position is ahead of the read position. These positions are not always identical due to 

possible buffering of captured data either on the physical device or in the host. The data after the read position up 

to and including the capture position is not necessarily valid data.<P>
