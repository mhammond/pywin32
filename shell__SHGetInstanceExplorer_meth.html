SHGetInstanceExplorer succeeds only if it is called from within 

an Explorer.exe or Iexplorer.exe process. It is typically used by 

components that run in the context of the Web browser (Iexplore.exe). 

However, it is also useful when Explorer.exe has been configured to 

run all folders in a second process. SHGetInstanceExplorer fails if 

the component is running in the default Explorer.exe process. There 

is no need to hold a reference to this process, as it is shut down 

only when the user logs out.<P>
