This function, as designed in MFC, returns both the *number* of parts, and, 

through an OUT parameter, an array of ints giving the coordinates of the 

parts.  There is also an IN parameter saying how many coordinates to give 

back.  Here, we're explicitly changing the semantics a bit.<P>

<BR>GetParts() -&gt Tuple of all coordinates 

<BR>GetParts(n) -&gt Tuple of the first n coordinates (or all coordinates, if 

fewer than n)<P>

So, in Python, you can't simultaneously find out how many coordinates there 

are, and retrieve a subset of them.  In a reasonable universe, there would 

have been GetParts() -&gt int, and GetCoords() -&gt List.  This means that I 

need to call the MFC method twice; once to find out how many there are, and 

another time to get them.<P>
