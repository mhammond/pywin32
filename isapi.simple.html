Simple base-classes for extensions and filters.<P>

<H3>Comments</H3>

None of the filter and extension functions are considered 'optional' by the 

framework.  These base-classes provide simple implementations for the 

Initialize and Terminate functions, allowing you to omit them,<P>

It is not necessary to use these base-classes - but if you don't, you 

must ensure each of the required methods are implemented.<P>
