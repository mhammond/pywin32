<TR><TD>DSCAPS_CONTINUOUSRATE</TD><TD>The device supports all sample rates between the dwMinSecondarySampleRate and 

dwMaxSecondarySampleRate member values. Typically, this means that the actual output rate will be within +/- 10 

hertz (Hz) of the requested frequency.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>DSCAPS_EMULDRIVER</TD><TD>The device does not have a DirectSound driver installed, so it is being emulated through 

the waveform-audio functions. Performance degradation should be expected.</TD></TR>

</TABLE><DT><B>integer dwMinSecondarySampleRate</B>

<DD>Minimum sample rate supported by this device's hardware secondary sound 

buffers.<P>



<DT><B>integer dwMaxSecondarySampleRate</B>

<DD>Maximum sample rate supported by this device's hardware secondary sound 

buffers.<P>



<DT><B>integer dwPrimaryBuffers</B>

<DD>Number of primary buffers supported. This value will always be 1.<P>



<DT><B>integer dwMaxHwMixingAllBuffers</B>

<DD>Specifies the total number of buffers that can be mixed in hardware. This 

member can be less than the sum of dwMaxHwMixingStaticBuffers and dwMaxHwMixingStreamingBuffers. Resource 

tradeoffs frequently occur.<P>



<DT><B>integer dwMaxHwMixingStaticBuffers</B>

<DD>Specifies the maximum number of static sound buffers.<P>



<DT><B>integer dwMaxHwMixingStreamingBuffers</B>

<DD>Specifies the maximum number of streaming sound buffers.<P>



<DT><B>integer dwFreeHwMixingAllBuffers</B>

<DD>Description of the free hardware mixing capabilities of the device. An 

application can use this value to determine whether hardware resources are available for allocation to a 

secondary sound buffer. Also, by comparing these values to the members that specify maximum mixing capabilities, 

the resources that are already allocated can be determined.<P>



<DT><B>integer dwFreeHwMixingStaticBuffers</B>

<DD>Description of the free hardware mixing capabilities of the device. An 

application can use this value to determine whether hardware resources are available for allocation to a 

secondary sound buffer. Also, by comparing these values to the members that specify maximum mixing capabilities, 

the resources that are already allocated can be determined.<P>



<DT><B>integer dwFreeHwMixingStreamingBuffers</B>

<DD>Description of the free hardware mixing capabilities of the device.

<DT><B>integer dwMaxHw3DAllBuffers</B>

<DD>Description of the hardware 3-D positional capabilities of the device.<P>



<DT><B>integer dwMaxHw3DStaticBuffers</B>

<DD>Description of the hardware 3-D positional capabilities of the device.<P>



<DT><B>integer dwMaxHw3DStreamingBuffers</B>

<DD>Description of the hardware 3-D positional capabilities of the device.<P>



<DT><B>integer dwFreeHw3DAllBuffers</B>

<DD>Description of the free, or unallocated, hardware 3-D positional capabilities 

of the device.<P>



<DT><B>integer dwFreeHw3DStaticBuffers</B>

<DD>Description of the free, or unallocated, hardware 3-D positional 

capabilities of the device.<P>



<DT><B>integer dwFreeHw3DStreamingBuffers</B>

<DD>Description of the free, or unallocated, hardware 3-D positional 

capabilities of the device.<P>



<DT><B>integer dwTotalHwMemBytes</B>

<DD>Size, in bytes, of the amount of memory on the sound card that stores static 

sound buffers.<P>



<DT><B>integer dwFreeHwMemBytes</B>

<DD>Size, in bytes, of the free memory on the sound card.<P>



<DT><B>integer dwMaxContigFreeHwMemBytes</B>

<DD>Size, in bytes, of the largest contiguous block of free memory on the 

sound card.<P>



<DT><B>integer dwUnlockTransferRateHwBuffers</B>

<DD>Description of the rate, in kilobytes per second, at which data can 

be transferred to hardware static sound buffers. This and the number of bytes transferred determines the duration 

of a call to the IDirectSoundBuffer::Update method.<P>



<DT><B>integer dwPlayCpuOverheadSwBuffers</B>

<DD>Description of the processing overhead, as a percentage of the central 

processing unit, needed to mix software buffers (those located in main system memory). This varies according to 

the bus type, the processor type, and the clock speed. The unlock transfer rate for software buffers is 0 because 

the data need not be transferred anywhere. Similarly, the play processing overhead for hardware buffers is 0 

because the mixing is done by the sound device.<P>
