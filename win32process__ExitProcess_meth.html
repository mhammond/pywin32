ExitProcess is the preferred method of ending a process. This function provides 

a clean process shutdown. This includes calling the entry-point function of all 

attached dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) with a value indicating that the process 

is detaching from the DLL. If a process terminates by calling 

<A HREF="win32process__TerminateProcess_meth.html">win32process::TerminateProcess</A>, the DLLs that the process is attached to are 

not notified of the process termination.<P>
