There is no need to call this for the main Python thread, as it is called 

automatically by pythoncom (using sys.coinit_flags as the param, or COINIT_APARTMENTTHREADED 

if sys.coinit_flags does not exist). 

<BR>You must call this manually if you create a thread which wishes to use COM.<P>

<H3>Return Value</H3>This function will raise pythoncom.error for all error 

return values, including RPC_E_CHANGED_MODE error.  This is 

in contrast to <A HREF="pythoncom__CoInitialize_meth.html">pythoncom::CoInitialize</A> which will hide that 

specific error.  If your code is happy to work in a threading model 

other than the one you specified, you must explicitly handle 

(and presumably ignore) this exception.<P>
