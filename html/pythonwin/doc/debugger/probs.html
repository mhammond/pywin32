<P>This document lists the currently known problems with the pywin.debugger package. </P>
<P>You may also wish to view the <A HREF="index.html">debugger overview</A>, the <A HREF="tutorial.html">debugger tutorial</A>, or the <A HREF="general.html">general debugger documentation</A>. </P>
<H3>Exiting the debugger on Windows 95 sometimes causes a crash.</H3>
<P>There is a problem with the "hierlist" control on Windows 95. I don't know what it is. </P>
<H3>Closing the main debugger application while debugging may cause strange results. </H3>
<P>This is particularly true when debugging non-Pythonwin applications. I have made some efforts in this area, but it is pretty hard and complex. </P>
<P>Closing the debugger dialog, selecting "End/Close" from one of the property pages, or "Close" from the debugging toolbar should always work as expected. </P>
<H3>Debugging the bottom call-stack does not work as expected. </H3>
<P>If you are ever debugging a function that is the <I>only</I> function in the call-stack (ie you are at the bottom stack), then the functions "run" "step out" and "step over" may not work as expected - each of these operations may function as a single-step. </P>
<P>You will need to single-step out of this entire function. </P>
<H3>Output window does not show function arguments </H3>
<P>This is a restriction in the core Python interpreter, caused by the introduction of keyword arguments. When Python supports it again, so will I.</P></BODY>
