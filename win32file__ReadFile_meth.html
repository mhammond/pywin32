<DD>Size of the buffer to create for the result, 

or a buffer to fill with the result. If a buffer object and overlapped is passed, the result is 

the buffer itself.  If a buffer but no overlapped is passed, the result is a new string object, 

built from the buffer, but with a length that reflects the data actually read.<P><DT><I>overlapped=None</I> : <A HREF="PyOVERLAPPED.html">PyOVERLAPPED</A><P>

<H3>Comments</H3>

in a multi-threaded overlapped environment, it is likely to be necessary to pre-allocate the read buffer using the <A HREF="win32file__AllocateReadBuffer_meth.html">win32file::AllocateReadBuffer</A> method, otherwise the I/O operation may complete before you can assign to the resulting buffer.<P>

<H3>Return Value</H3>The result is a tuple of (hr, string/<A HREF="PyOVERLAPPEDReadBuffer.html">PyOVERLAPPEDReadBuffer</A>), where hr may be 

0, ERROR_MORE_DATA or ERROR_IO_PENDING. 

If the overlapped param is not None, then the result is a <A HREF="PyOVERLAPPEDReadBuffer.html">PyOVERLAPPEDReadBuffer</A>.  Once the overlapped IO operation 

has completed, you can convert this to a string (str(object)) [py2k] or (bytes(object)) [py3k] to obtain the data. 

While the operation is in progress, you can use the slice operations (object[:end]) to 

obtain the data read so far. 

You must use the OVERLAPPED API functions to determine how much of the data is valid.<P>
