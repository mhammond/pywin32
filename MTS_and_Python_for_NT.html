How to use python w/MTS on NT.<P>

<BR>MTS represents microsoft's attempt to simplify computing for a 

distributed system. Where COM is all about identity, MTS manages 

state.  It introduces new ideas and you'll find corresponding 

terminology like: object and state context, activity, causality. It 

also represents a push towards declarative programming -- where you 

declare how a class can exist and the operating system provides the 

services to handle that (instead of you having to deal with 

it). Windows 2000 offers a further set of refinements, though what's 

documented here will hopefully be backward compatible.<P>

<BR>In this example, we'll specifically deal with a simple case that 

can show the transaction monitor in use. We have an active server page 

(using python of course) making calls to a python MTS component. The 

component then makes simple use of ObjectContext interfaces and 

decides whether or not the transaction is a success or failure.<P>

<BR>To insert a python COM object into MTS, you want to register your 

COM object,setup an MTS package, and then add the python component to 

the package as a component that is already registered. After it is 

added, do not then register the component using python, as it will 

overwrite the changes MTS did. To create a package, open up the 

Transaction Server Explorer from the Option Pack, go to My Computer -&gt 

Packages Installed, right click and select new and create an empty 

package. From there you can call the package whatever you want and let 

it run as whomever. Then open up the package you created, right click 

on Components, select New Component, and finally select Import 

components that are already registered, from which you highlight your 

python component it provides in the list. You can also right click on 

Roles in your package to create a role you can put users or groups 

in. The last thing you need to do is right-click on your component in 

the package, select properties, and finally transaction. Then select 

the radio button next to: 'Requires a transaction'.<P>

<BR>As stated before, this example is interested in ObjectContext. The 

ObjectContext interface is like a friend doing things on your 

behalf. You declare what you want, and it helps you with that, always 

acting as a buffer between you and the outside world. Many methods are 

available from this interface: CreateInstance, SetComplete, SetAbort, 

EnableCommit, DisableCommit, IsInTransaction, IsCallerInRole, etc.<P>

<BR>In this example we will deal with: SetComplete and SetAbort, and 

IsCallerInRole. Invoking SetComplete will tell MTS that the object is 

done and it can go ahead and commit. In contrast, SetAbort means the 

object is done but for whatever the transaction must roll 

back. IsCallerInRole determines whether or not the client calling the object 

is in the role you created that has lists of users or groups.<P>

<H3>Example</H3>In python you setup the ObjectContext object in the following manner:<P>

<PRE>mtsobj = win32com.client.Dispatch("MTXAS.AppServer.1")

mts=mtsobj.GetObjectContext()

</PRE>

and can then make calls like:<P>

<PRE>if mts.IsCallerInRole('bedrock'):

&#09do_this()



&ltnl&gtBelow is the active server page and python object that you can

watch at work using "Transaction Statistics" in the Transaction Server

Explorer. Anything but wilma and betty will cause the aborted list to

increment. If wila or betty are supplied from the ASP, you notice

Committed increasing.

Here is an extremely simple python active server page that calls the mts object:<P>

<PRE>&ltSCRIPT Language="Python" RunAt="Server"&gt



import win32com

find_pebbles = win32com.client.dynamic.Dispatch("mts1")



a=find_pebbles('wilma')

Response.Write(a)



&lt/SCRIPT&gt

</PRE>

Here is the mts COM object:<P>

<PRE>from win32com.server.exception import COMException

import win32com.server.util

import win32com.client.dynamic



# to generate guids use:

# import pythoncom

# print(pythoncom.CreateGuid())



class Mts:

&#09# COM attributes.

&#09&#09       #guid for your class in registry

&#09_reg_desc_ = "test mts functions"

&#09_reg_progid_ = "mts1" #The progid for this class

&#09_reg_class_spec_ = "mts_test.Mts"

&#09&#09&#09   #tells Python how to create the object: filename.class

&#09_public_methods_ = ['getkid' ]  #names of callable methods



&#09def __init__(self):

&#09&#09pass



&#09def getkid(self, person):



&#09&#09mtsobj = win32com.client.Dispatch("MTXAS.AppServer.1")

&#09&#09mts=mtsobj.GetObjectContext()



&#09&#09if mts is None:

&#09&#09&#09#com obj -- no mts

&#09&#09&#09result='error: mts not available'

&#09&#09else:

&#09&#09&#09#mts is available

&#09&#09&#09#first check if they are in the right role

&#09&#09&#09if mts.IsCallerInRole('bedrock'):

&#09&#09&#09&#09moms={'wilma':'bambam','betty':'pebbles'}

&#09&#09&#09&#09person=str(person) #convert from unicode to string

&#09&#09&#09&#09if moms.has_key(person):

&#09&#09&#09&#09&#09mts.SetComplete()

&#09&#09&#09&#09&#09result=moms[person]

&#09&#09&#09&#09else:

&#09&#09&#09&#09&#09result='not in bedrock'

&#09&#09&#09&#09&#09mts.SetAbort()

&#09&#09&#09else:

&#09&#09&#09&#09result='sorry can't let you know'

&#09&#09return result



if __name__=='__main__':

&#09import win32com.server.register

&#09win32com.server.register.UseCommandLine(Mts)

Have a great time with programming with python!
