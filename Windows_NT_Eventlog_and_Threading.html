Python's threading to manage access access to many Eventlogs<P>

<BR>If you need to access the eventlog of many servers, it can take 

quite some time if you go through a list sequentially -- since you 

need to wait for each operation to complete. There are a few ways you 

can do this in python.  You can spawn many processes, use python's 

win32 libraries for win32 style-threading, or use python's native 

libraries.<P>

<BR>In NT spawning a process is slow (though in this case that may not 

matter) and it can be a little cumbersome to get them to share 

data. Since python's win32 libraries are thread-safe, you can use 

python's win32 libraries to do win32-style threading or use python's 

native threading library to spawn threads. Win32 style threading is 

available via python's win32process library. It gives you excellent 

control and ability to do some sophisticated stuff, however raw win32 

threaded programming can be tricky. The final option is Python's 

native high-level threading library which is built on top of a lower 

level thread library. It turns out that it is easy to use and 

cross-platform (well at least to platforms that support 

threading). It's only disadvantage is that your thread 

control(synchronization, giving them priorities, suspending them, 

etc.)  is limited. In many cases, however, that is not important, you 

just need the ability to _easily_ do a few things at once.  Thus, 

we'll focus on Python's native threading.<P>

<BR>One final note, the python interpreter has a global lock for 

threads forcing them to run serially. Which means only one thread can 

intrepret python code at any given time. After a certain amount of 

python code has been run, then control is switched to another 

thread. Thus, this means you can't have things like many threads 

running on many processors. Fortunately, in cases with I/O and 

extension modules (in which you can manipulate the interpreter lock), 

this isn't an issue. In our case (accessing the eventlog of many 

servers) the global lock shouldn't be a bottleneck(i/o will be).<P>

<BR>There are a couple of ways to use the threading library. We'll 

look at the case in which you override the run method of the 

threading.Thread class. The run method will contain the actual 

code you want to run many times.<P>

<BR>The basic procedure to follow is this. 

For every server in the list: 

1)create a thread class 

2)call start method in thread class(which invokes your run method) 

3)call join method to force main thread to wait for threads to complete 

4)compile data together from all thread classes created.<P>

Since you don't use the return values of the 

thread, you need to store data with the thread object that you 

create. Furthermore, you'll notice we use the join method to force the 

calling thread to wait for the other threads to finish.<P>

<H3>Example</H3>Here is the skeleton of that:<P>

<PRE>#We are overiding run() method of the threading.Thread class.

class thread_it ( threading.Thread ) :

  def __init__ ( self, server) :

    threading.Thread.__init__(self)

    self.data=[] #store data here to get later

    self.server=server

# the start() method invokes run

  def run ( self ): #overridden from threading library

    try:

      pass #get event information here and store in data

    except:

      #append any errors to self.data, to get later

      self.data.append('Error for '+self.server+':'+str(traceback.print_exc(sys.exc_info())))



######main here

try:

    l_servers=('fred','barney','wilma','betty')

    for server in l_servers: #make a thread for each server

&#09    thread = thread_it (server)

&#09    threads.append ( thread ) #append to the a threads list



    for thread in threads: #now go thru list and start threads running

&#09    thread.start()



    for thread in threads: #make main thread wait for all in list to complete

&#09thread.join()



    for thread in threads:

&#09&#09    # print(thread results)

&#09for event in thread.data:

&#09&#09  print(event)





except:

    print(traceback.print_exc(sys.exc_info()))

</PRE>

Looking at the skeleton, all one really needs to do is put the 

eventlog code in the run function and have it store results in the 

data variable. The main part is almost boilerplate code.  So you can 

see multi-threading at work, I've added a 'now' column to the eventlog 

printout which tells you the current time, and easily shows that the 

data was gathered simultaneously on the servers.<P>

A very nice addition to this would be to convert it to a web 

application. HTMLgen is a useful tool in this context.<P>

<BR>Have a great time with programming with python!
