Sets the application to the exclusive level. When it has the input focus, the 

application will be the only one audible (sounds from applications with the DSBCAPS_GLOBALFOCUS flag set will be 

muted). With this level, it also has all the privileges of the DSSCL_PRIORITY level. DirectSound will restore the 

hardware format, as specified by the most recent call to the DirectSoundBuffer.setFormat method, once the 

application gains the input focus. (Note that DirectSound will always restore the wave format, no matter what 

priority level is set.)<P>
