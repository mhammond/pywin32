Due to peculiarities of the underlying system calls, this method will only be called once, 

and subsequent calls will return the information obtained on the first call.  As a consequence, a new 

instance of the interface will need to be created for each object whose security is to be displayed.<P>

<H3>Return Value</H3>Your implementation of this method should return a <A HREF="SI_OBJECT_INFO.html">SI_OBJECT_INFO</A> tuple<P>
