Python's win32 access for file properties to enable deletes<P>

<BR>Sometimes you may want to do something like remove entire 

directory trees. Python has some great utilities to do that, except 

files with special attributes cannot be typically deleted.<P>

<BR>To get around this problem you need to use the win32 call to 

SetFileAttributes to be a normal file.<P>

The C++ call looks like this:<P>

BOOL SetFileAttributes( 

LPCTSTR lpFileName, 

DWORD dwFileAttributes 

);<P>

You provide it 2 arguments the filename and the specific attributes 

and it returns whether or not it succeeded.<P>

The corresponding python call is: 

int = win32api.SetFileAttributes( pathName, attrs )<P>

The only question is where do you get attrs. It is included in the 

ever handy win32con module specifically -- 

win32con.FILE_ATTRIBUTE_*. You can set a file to be read only, 

archive, hidden, etc. We are concerned with setting it back to normal, 

so we want: win32con.FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL<P>

The example below can be useful, but, of course, be careful with it, 

since it deletes a lot of stuff. It is a recursive function  The example 

also makes use of some handy functions from the os module.<P>

<H3>Example</H3>Here is a basic example of how to remove a directory tree:<P>

<PRE>import win32con

import win32api

import os



def del_dir(self,path):

&#09for file in os.listdir(path):

&#09&#09file_or_dir = os.path.join(path,file)

&#09&#09if os.path.isdir(file_or_dir) and not os.path.islink(file_or_dir):

&#09&#09&#09del_dir(file_or_dir) #it's a directory reucursive call to function again

&#09&#09else:

&#09&#09&#09try:

&#09&#09&#09&#09os.remove(file_or_dir) #it's a file, delete it

&#09&#09&#09except:

&#09&#09&#09&#09#probably failed because it is not a normal file

&#09&#09&#09&#09win32api.SetFileAttributes(file_or_dir, win32con.FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL)

&#09&#09&#09&#09os.remove(file_or_dir) #it's a file, delete it

&#09&#09os.rmdir(path) #delete the directory here

Have a great time with programming with python!
