<h1><a name="SUMMARY">SUMMARY</a></h1>
<p>
Python is a rich scripting language offering a lot of the
power of C++ while retaining the ease of use of VBscript. With it's
simplified C++ style, win32 access, and ability to make COM servers, it's a natural
rapid development environment for the developer.
</p>

<p>
When working with an unfamiliar API, python is great for helping you
understand how to solve the problem without getting in the way. Even
if you have to supply a C++ COM object, it is often easier to first
figure out the details with python and then compose the C++ solution.
Python is very similar to C++ pseudo-code, so you can follow it as an
outline for the C++. In this case, we're going to talk about how to
use both python and C++ to expose a list of processes and their
corresponding ids with a COM object.
</p>

<hr>
<h2><A NAME="Introduction">Introduction</A></h2>
<p>

To get process information,
you can use the Performance Data Helper library(PDH) available in the
SDK at microsoft's ftp site. It provides a convenient interface to
performance information stored fundamentally in the registry. The
basic process of using the PDH encompasses the following:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Get a list of all the objects you want
<li>Get a list of the object's instances and data available for each instance: called 'items' or 'counters'
<li>Get a group of performance data for each counter
</ol>
<p>
In our case the object we want is the process object, the object's
instances are it's list of processes, and the counter we want for the
processes is 'ID Process'.
</p>
<p>
The specific set of API called are the following:
<ol>
<li>PdhEnumObjectItems -- get the list of instances (processes) for the process object</li>
<li>PdhOpenQuery -- initialize query handle which will contain all the counters (in our case only: ID Process)</li>
<li>PdhMakeCounterPath -- Each counter has a specific path, kind of like like a url </li>
<li>PdhAddCounter -- convert the path to a handle and group the counters paths(in this case only one) together for the query</li>
<li>PdhCollectQueryData -- gathers the actual data </li>
<li>PdhGetFormattedCounterValue -- call for each counter to convert the data to a typical format </li>
<li>PdhCloseQuery -- close the counters and the query handle</li>
</ol>

</p>
<p>
We'll cover these points now in more depth.
</p>
<hr>
<h2><A NAME="PdhEnumObjectItems">Getting the process list: PdhEnumObjectItems</A></h2>
<p>
The MSDN describes the call as the following:
</p>
<p>
<code>
PDH_STATUS PdhEnumObjectItems(
  LPCTSTR szDataSource,
  LPCTSTR szMachineName,
  LPCTSTR szObjectName,
  LPTSTR mszCounterList,
  LPDWORD pcchCounterListLength,
  LPTSTR mszInstanceList,
  LPDWORD pcchInstanceListLength,
  DWORD dwDetailLevel,
  DWORD dwFlags
);
</code>
</p>
<p>
The python call is similar though simpler. For example, you do not
need to bother with the list length -- it takes care of that for
you. Both the python and C++ examples are taken from their COM
components shown later.To call make with python would look like the
following

<p>
<code>
    def proclist(self):
        try:
            junk, instances = win32pdh.EnumObjectItems(None,None,self.object, win32pdh.PERF_DETAIL_WIZARD)
            return instances
        except:
            raise COMException("Problem getting process list")
</code>
<p>
The variable instances contains the list of processes, and you'll find the item or counter than we want
'ID Process' present in the list of items.


Since you can have multiple processes with the same name, in
python it is convenient to use a dictionary to store a list of
processes and how many you found for each type.
</p>
<p>
<pre>
    for instance in instances:
        if proc_dict.has_key(instance):
            proc_dict[instance] = proc_dict[instance] + 1
        else:
            proc_dict[instance]=0
</pre>
</p>

<p>

The C++ call though essentially the same in spirit is much more
involved. To help, I use map(like a python dictionary) and string from
Standard C++. The additional things you need to manage are:
<ul>
<li>strings -- convert to TCHAR for ansi/unicode support using ATL macros</li>
<li>the memory for the buffers that PdhEnumObjectItems needs</li>
<li>Parse it's NULL padded results.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<code>
HRESULT getinst (map &lt; string,int &gt; & m_inst) {

	map&lt;string, int&gt;::iterator iter;

<h2><a NAME="Counters">Getting the process ids: Several Pdh Calls</a></h2>
<p>
A whole sequence of calls are necessary once you get the process list. To refresh your memory, you need:
<ol>
<li>PdhOpenQuery -- initialize query handle which will contain all the counters (in our case only: ID Process)</li>
<li>PdhMakeCounterPath -- Each counter has a specific path, kind of like like a url </li>
<li>PdhAddCounter -- convert the path to a handle and group the counters paths(in this case only one) together for the query</li>
<li>PdhCollectQueryData -- gathers the actual data </li>
<li>PdhGetFormattedCounterValue -- call for each counter to convert the data to a typical format </li>
<li>PdhCloseQuery -- close the counters and the query handle</li>
</ol>

As usual the python code matches this very cleanly (like pseudocode that actually runs) -- you can figure
out the basic meanings and sequences of the win32 calls without having to deal with other details.

<p>
<code>
        for instance, max_instances in proc_dict.items():
            for inum in xrange(max_instances+1):
                try:
                    hq = win32pdh.OpenQuery() # initializes the query handle
                    path = win32pdh.MakeCounterPath( (None,self.object,instance, None, inum, self.item) )
                    counter_handle=win32pdh.AddCounter(hq, path) #convert counter path to counter handle
                    win32pdh.CollectQueryData(hq) #collects data for the counter
                    type, val = win32pdh.GetFormattedCounterValue(counter_handle, win32pdh.PDH_FMT_LONG)
                    proc_ids.append(instance+'\t'+str(val))
                    win32pdh.CloseQuery(hq)
                except:
                    raise COMException("Problem getting process id")
</code>

<p>
Again, the C++ code is more involved and makes use of Standard C++, vector, map, and string.
It converts a map of process names and the number for each name, to a vector of strings each which
has tab-delimited process id entry. Also, the process id info is returned in the format of a double, which
is converted to a string.
</p>
<p>

<hr><h2><a name="client">The COM client.</a></h2>
The Python COM client which will call the C++ COM object and Python COM object does the following:
</p>
<p>
<code>
     import win32com.client
     a=win32com.client.Dispatch('NtPerf.process') # C++ com object
     print(a.procids())

     b=win32com.client.Dispatch('PyPerf.process') # python com object
     print(b.procids())
</code>
</p>
<p>
As far as it is concerned, there is no difference between the 2 objects. Both returns a list of processes and their
respective id's separated by tab.
</p>


<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="COM">Making the COM objects.</a></h2>

<p>From a 1000 mile perspective, ATL C++ and python offer a class
based COM object approach. In both approaches, the methods of the com
object are simply methods of a class. However, creating a COM object
in python is much easier than C++, again allowing you to focus on the
problem first while still retaining the C++ feel.
</p>

<p> Much of the details with python COM objects are exposed through a
default policy which leverages IDispatch. You simply add a few
attributes your python class, to expose your methods, prog id, add a
line to register your class, and you are done. The policy knows
what to do. Thus, it's easy enough to take a simple win32 class you
wrote and add a few attributes and convert it to a COM
object. Creating and developing python COM objects is simple, all that
is needed is notepad. You don't need a full blown IDE nor do you have
to go back and find the source code that created the object, since the
object is the source code. It lends itself to very rapid development.
</p>

<p>
ATL provides wizards and a lot of the basic implementation goo (like
COM interfaces for IUnknown and IDispatch), and wrappers for data
types. However, there still a big difference between a simple console
based app and an ATL COM object. The COM world of Variants,
SafeArrays, and BSTR's is (as we'll see below) unfriendly to C++.
</p>

<p> Python behind the scenes converts back and forth between it's
native types and BSTR, Variants, SafeArrays, etc. When you change your
COM object, you don't have to worry about changing IDL and
constructing new Variant structures, it is managed for you.
</p>

<p> In C++, it is more messy. First of all: strings. Since the concept
of what text is isn't consistent, COM standardizes with it's own
OLECHAR. Also, for non-COM text, because of issues between using ansi
and unicode, you need to use the TCHAR data type which is a generic
type that maps at compile time to what is necessary. And, with regard to
BSTRs (length-prefixed strings), you need to convert the OLECHAR to
BSTR's with SysAllocString. You notice the COM object below uses the
Standard C++ string (which I prefer to use).  When necessary, it
converts the string it to the necessary COM type leveraging ATL
conversion macros and SysAllocString (another option is to use the
CComBSTR class).
</p>

<p>Secondly: arrays. Since we are returning a list of processes and
their ids, to be friendly with all languages, everything needs to
be converted to SafeArrays of Variants housing BSTRs. Python does the
conversion for you. With C++, you'll need to make various Variant
calls to create the necessary structure.  In the C++ COM object, I've
encapsulated all the necessary code in a single function that converts
any vector of strings into a 1 dimensional safe array of variants.
<p>

</p>
<p>
Now for some code:
</p>

<p>
<hr><h2><a NAME="pythoncom">The Python COM object.</a></h2> The Python
COM object has 2 methods proclist and procids. Proclist is trivial,
simply returning the list of processes from EnumObjectItems. Procids
calls proclist, constructs a dictionary to count the number of
processes with the same name, and then makes the necessary calls to
their their ids. Each function simple returns the python list (which
is then converted for you). If you later decide to only return a
single string, simple change what you return, and python again will
convert for you. Each method also uses the very cool function
COMException which returns errors back to the client. In addition to
the methods, there are 4 basic attributes, I set to define the COM
object and a line to register it.

<hr><h2><a name="C++com">The C++ COM object.</a></h2>

<p>
As you notice from the idl, C++ COM object also exposes 2 methods,
proclist and procids. Proclist calls the getinst function returns
returns a map of processes, converts that to a vector of strings, and
the calls make_safe to convert that to a Safe array of
Variants. Procids does much the same except that after calling
getinst, it then calls getprocid, which returns a vector of strings
containing the processes and their ids. The vector of strings is then
converted to a SafeArray with make_safe. Unlike python, you don't actually
return the SafeArray(since every COM method has to return an HRESULT). Instead,
you store the values in a Variant pointer.
</p>

That was a quick tour of Python and C++ in the win32 and COM
world. Both languages have their strengths and weaknesses. With C++
you have ultimate granularity and power. It obviously comes at a cost
of more details to keep track of. Python's strength is rich
productivity. It is fast to write the win32 and COM sever code, yet
still have a sophisticated language at your disposal. You lose some of
the flexibility of C++, which often does not matter. And, when it
does, python can help you understand how to solve the problem, before wading
into the details.
