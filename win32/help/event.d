@topic Windows NT Eventlog |Python's win32 access for the Eventlog

<nl>If you need to scan the eventlog of many servers or do specific
filtering based off of the event log, python's win32evtlog
win32evtlogutil libraries give you an means to do it efficiently.

The library of primary importance is win32evtlog. With it you can
connect to a server's eventlog with the call.
@ex Here is the basic call:|

logtype='System'
hand=win32evtlog.OpenEventLog(server,logtype)

@ex This returns a handle from which you can make calls such as one that
will give you the total number of events or another examine the
details for each event. The logtype variable is set to the type of log
you want to look at. The default ones are: Application, Security, and System.

After you have the handle you can get ask for things such as the number of
records, or the specific event records: |

total=win32evtlog.GetNumberOfEventLogRecords(hand)
flags = win32evtlog.EVENTLOG_BACKWARDS_READ|win32evtlog.EVENTLOG_SEQUENTIAL_READ
events=win32evtlog.ReadEventLog(hand,flags,0)

@ex ReadEventLog returns a number of event objects which may not be all of
them.  You need to continously check in a loop until there are no more
events returned by ReadEventLog. You may notice that ReadEventLog has
a flags argument.  The flags (which are convinently available with the
win32evtlog library) specify how to read the event log.

<nl>Here is a simple loop getting the data from the events that ReadEventLog
returned:|

for ev_obj in events:
	the_time=ev_obj.TimeGenerated.Format() #'12/23/99 15:54:09'
	evt_id=str(winerror.HRESULT_CODE(ev_obj.EventID))
	computer=str(ev_obj.ComputerName)
	cat=ev_obj.EventCategory
        seconds=date2sec(the_time)
        record=ev_obj.RecordNumber
	msg=str(win32evtlogutil.SafeFormatMessage(ev_obj, logtype))
	source=str(ev_obj.SourceName)

@ex We use the library win32evtlogutil to get the actual text body for the
event.  To get a easily readable date for the event, you need to
specify the 'Format' method for the TimeGenerated part of the event
object.

<nl>The win32evtlogutil comes in handy to give us the actual text body of
the eventlog message.  If you want to do any sorting based of off
time, here is a handy function that converts the eventlog's time
format into seconds using's python's time and regexp library:|

def date2sec(self,evt_date):
	'''
	converts '12/23/99 15:54:09' to seconds
	print("333333",evt_date)
	'''
	regexp=re.compile('(.*)\s(.*)')
	reg_result=regexp.search(evt_date)
	date=reg_result.group(1)
	the_time=reg_result.group(2)
	(mon,day,yr)=map(lambda x: int(x),date.split('/'))
	(hr,min,sec)=map(lambda x: int(x),the_time.split(':'))
	tup=[yr,mon,day,hr,min,sec,0,0,0]
	sec=time.mktime(tup)
	return sec

@ex If you want to get the current localtime in seconds, you can make the call:
begin_sec=time.time(). To convert that to a date use:
begin_time=str(time.strftime('%H:%M:%S  ',time.localtime( begin_sec )))

<nl>Finally here is all the code that puts together an application which looks
for all events for a server since a certain time.

<nl>Find events: |

def date2sec(evt_date):
	'''

	'12/23/99 15:54:09' to seconds since 1970.
	'''
	regexp=re.compile('(.*)\s(.*)') #store result in site
	reg_result=regexp.search(evt_date)
	date=reg_result.group(1)
	the_time=reg_result.group(2)
	(mon,day,yr)=map(lambda x: int(x),date.split('/'))
	(hr,min,sec)=map(lambda x: int(x),the_time.split(':'))
	tup=[yr,mon,day,hr,min,sec,0,0,0]

	sec=time.mktime(tup)

	return sec

        print(":".join((the_time,computer,src,cat,record,evt_id,evt_type,msg[0:15])))

    if seconds < begin_sec-28800: break #get out of while loop as well
  win32evtlog.CloseEventLog(hand)
except:
    print(traceback.print_exc(sys.exc_info()))


	Some useful additions to this would be to make it
multi-threaded and deploy it as a web application, to look at many servers.

@topic Windows NT Eventlog and Threading |Python's threading to manage access access to many Eventlogs

<nl>If you need to access the eventlog of many servers, it can take
quite some time if you go through a list sequentially -- since you
need to wait for each operation to complete. There are a few ways you
can do this in python.  You can spawn many processes, use python's
win32 libraries for win32 style-threading, or use python's native
libraries.

<nl>In NT spawning a process is slow (though in this case that may not
matter) and it can be a little cumbersome to get them to share
data. Since python's win32 libraries are thread-safe, you can use
python's win32 libraries to do win32-style threading or use python's
native threading library to spawn threads. Win32 style threading is
available via python's win32process library. It gives you excellent
control and ability to do some sophisticated stuff, however raw win32
threaded programming can be tricky. The final option is Python's
native high-level threading library which is built on top of a lower
level thread library. It turns out that it is easy to use and
cross-platform (well at least to platforms that support
threading). It's only disadvantage is that your thread
control(synchronization, giving them priorities, suspending them,
etc.)  is limited. In many cases, however, that is not important, you
just need the ability to _easily_ do a few things at once.  Thus,
we'll focus on Python's native threading.

<nl>One final note, the python interpreter has a global lock for
threads forcing them to run serially. Which means only one thread can
intrepret python code at any given time. After a certain amount of
python code has been run, then control is switched to another
thread. Thus, this means you can't have things like many threads
running on many processors. Fortunately, in cases with I/O and
extension modules (in which you can manipulate the interpreter lock),
this isn't an issue. In our case (accessing the eventlog of many
servers) the global lock shouldn't be a bottleneck(i/o will be).

<nl>There are a couple of ways to use the threading library. We'll
look at the case in which you override the run method of the
threading.Thread class. The run method will contain the actual
code you want to run many times.

<nl>The basic procedure to follow is this.
For every server in the list:
1)create a thread class
2)call start method in thread class(which invokes your run method)
3)call join method to force main thread to wait for threads to complete
4)compile data together from all thread classes created.

Since you don't use the return values of the
thread, you need to store data with the thread object that you
create. Furthermore, you'll notice we use the join method to force the
calling thread to wait for the other threads to finish.

@ex Here is the skeleton of that: |

#We are overiding run() method of the threading.Thread class.
class thread_it ( threading.Thread ) :
  def __init__ ( self, server) :
    threading.Thread.__init__(self)
    self.data=[] #store data here to get later
    self.server=server
# the start() method invokes run
  def run ( self ): #overridden from threading library
    try:
      pass #get event information here and store in data
    except:
      #append any errors to self.data, to get later
      self.data.append('Error for '+self.server+':'+str(traceback.print_exc(sys.exc_info())))

######main here
try:
    l_servers=('fred','barney','wilma','betty')
    for server in l_servers: #make a thread for each server
            thread = thread_it (server)
            threads.append ( thread ) #append to the a threads list

    for thread in threads: #now go thru list and start threads running
            thread.start()

    for thread in threads: #make main thread wait for all in list to complete
        thread.join()

    for thread in threads:
		    # print(thread results)
        for event in thread.data:
	          print(event)


except:
    print(traceback.print_exc(sys.exc_info()))




@ex Looking at the skeleton, all one really needs to do is put the
eventlog code in the run function and have it store results in the
data variable. The main part is almost boilerplate code.  So you can
see multi-threading at work, I've added a 'now' column to the eventlog
printout which tells you the current time, and easily shows that the
data was gathered simultaneously on the servers.

@ex A very nice addition to this would be to convert it to a web
