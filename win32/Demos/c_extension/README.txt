This directory contains a sample Python extension module which
includes PyWinTypes.h and links against PyWinTypesXX.lib  The same technique
can be used to include and extend pythoncom.

The sample does nothing useful other than to show how to compile and link
such an extension using a standard pywin32 installation.
