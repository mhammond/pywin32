The arc drawn by using the function is a segment of the ellipse defined by the specified bounding 

rectangle. The actual starting point of the arc is the point at which a ray drawn from the center of the bounding 

rectangle through the specified starting point intersects the ellipse. The actual ending point of the arc is the 

point at which a ray drawn from the center of the bounding rectangle through 

the specified ending point intersects the ellipse. The arc is drawn in a 

counterclockwise direction. Since an arc is not a closed figure, it is 

not filled. Both the width and height of the rectangle must be greater 

than 2 units and less than 32,767 units.<P>
