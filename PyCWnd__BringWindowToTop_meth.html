<H3>Comments</H3>

This method activates pop-up, top-level, and MDI child windows. 

The BringWindowToTop member function should be used to uncover any window that is partially or 

completely obscured by any overlapping windows.<BR> 

Calling this method is similar to calling the <A HREF="PyCWnd__SetWindowPos_meth.html">PyCWnd::SetWindowPos</A> method to 

change a window's position in the Z order. The BringWindowToTop method 

does not change the window style to make it a top-level window of the desktop.<P>
