A Python wrapper of a COM IPersistStorage interface.<P>

<H3>Comments</H3>

The IPersistStorage interface defines methods that enable a container application to pass a storage object to 

one of its contained objects and to load and save the storage object. This interface supports the structured storage 

model, in which each contained object has its own storage that is nested within the container's storage.<P>
