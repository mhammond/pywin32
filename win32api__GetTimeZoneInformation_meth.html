<DD>If true, the SYSTEMTIME elements are returned as tuples instead of a time 

object. Defaults to True, because this function 

returns SYSTEMTIME information with members which datetime treats as 

invalid. In other words, using False will result in ValueErrors 

instead of returning.<P>

<DD>Specifies the current bias, in minutes, for local time translation on this computer. The 

bias is the difference, in minutes, between Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and local time. All translations 

between UTC and local time are based on the following formula:<BR><BR>UTC = local time + bias <BR><BR><P></DL>

<DL><DT>[1] <I>unicode</I> : standardName<P>

<DD>Specifies a string associated with standard time on this operating system. For 

example, this member could contain "EST" to indicate Eastern Standard Time. This string is not used by the 

operating system, so anything stored there using the SetTimeZoneInformation function is returned unchanged by the 

GetTimeZoneInformation function. This string can be empty.<P></DL>

<DL><DT>[2] <I><A HREF="PyDateTime.html">PyDateTime</A>/tuple</I> : standardTime<P>

<DD>Specifies a SYSTEMTIME object that contains a date and local time 

when the transition from daylight saving time to standard time occurs on this operating system. If this date is 

not specified, the wMonth member in the SYSTEMTIME structure must be zero. If this date is specified, the 

DaylightDate value in the TIME_ZONE_INFORMATION structure must also be specified. <BR>To select the correct day 

in the month, set the wYear member to zero, the wDayOfWeek member to an appropriate weekday, and the wDay member 

to a value in the range 1 through 5. Using this notation, the first Sunday in April can be specified, as can the 

last Thursday in October (5 is equal to "the last").<P></DL>

<DL><DT>[3] <I>int</I> : standardBias<P>

<DD>Specifies a bias value to be used during local time translations that occur during 

standard time. This member is ignored if a value for the StandardDate member is not supplied. <BR>This value is 

added to the value of the Bias member to form the bias used during standard time. In most time zones, the value 

of this member is zero.<P></DL>

<DD>Specifies a bias value to be used during local time translations that occur during 

daylight saving time. This member is ignored if a value for the DaylightDate member is not supplied. <BR>This 

value is added to the value of the Bias member to form the bias used during daylight saving time. In most time 

zones, the value of this member is 60.<P></DL>
