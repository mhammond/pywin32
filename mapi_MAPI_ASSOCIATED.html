The container's associated contents table should be returned rather than the standard contents table. This flag is used only with folders. The messages that are included in the associated contents table were created with the MAPI_ASSOCIATED flag set in the call to IMAPIFolder::CreateMessage. Clients typically use the associated contents table to retrieve forms and views.<P>
