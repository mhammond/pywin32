If the object is dirty, the <A HREF="PyIOleObject__Close_meth.html">PyIOleObject::Close</A> implementation should display a dialog box to let the end user 

determine whether to save the object. However, if the object is in the running state 

but its user interface is invisible, the end user should not be prompted, and the 

close should be handled as if OLECLOSE_SAVEIFDIRTY had been specified.<P>
