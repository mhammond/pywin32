Identifies a resource or function in a module. 

This can be a WORD-sized integer value (0-65536), or unicode. 

Class atoms as used with <A HREF="win32gui__CreateWindow_meth.html">win32gui::CreateWindow</A> are also treated 

as resource ids since they can also be represented by a name or WORD id. 

When passing resource names and types as strings, they are usually formatted 

as a pound sign followed by decimal form of the id.  ('#42' for example)<P>
