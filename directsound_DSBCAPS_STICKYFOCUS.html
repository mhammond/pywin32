Changes the focus behavior of the sound buffer. This flag can be specified 

in an IDirectSound::CreateSoundBuffer call. With this flag set, an application using DirectSound can continue to 

play its sticky focus buffers if the user switches to another application not using DirectSound. In this 

situation, the application's normal buffers are muted, but the sticky focus buffers are still audible. This is 

useful for nongame applications, such as movie playback (DirectShow&#194&#174), when the user wants to hear the soundtrack 

while typing in Microsoft Word or Microsoft&#194&#174 Excel, for example. However, if the user switches to another 

DirectSound application, all sound buffers, both normal and sticky focus, in the previous application are muted.<P>
