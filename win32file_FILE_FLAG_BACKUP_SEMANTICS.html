Windows NT only: Indicates that the file is being opened or created for a backup or restore operation. 

The operating system ensures that the calling process overrides file security checks, provided it has the necessary permission to do so. The relevant permissions are SE_BACKUP_NAME and SE_RESTORE_NAME. 

You can also set this flag to obtain a handle to a directory. A directory handle can be passed to some Win32 functions in place of a file handle.<P>
