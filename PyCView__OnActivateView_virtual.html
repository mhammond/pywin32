If a handler exists, the base MFC implementation is not called. 

<BR>The activateView and deactiveView parameters are the same objects if the 

application's main frame window is activated with no change in the 

active view for example, if the focus is being transferred from 

another application to this one, rather than from one view to 

another within the application. 

This allows a view to re-realize its palette, if needed.<P>
