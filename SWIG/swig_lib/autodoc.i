%section " Introduction"
%text %{
This file describes all of the functions in the generic SWIG library.
The SWIG library is a collection of generally useful functions that
can be used to supplement an interface file.  These include functions
to manipulate arrays, functions from the C library, and interesting
modules.

This document is automatically generated by SWIG from the file
"swig_lib/autodoc.i".   Some modules may supply additional documentation
for a particular target language.  To recreate the documentation for
a particular target language, simply run SWIG on the file 'autodoc.i'
with the appropriate target language option.

%subsection "Call for contributions"
%text %{
My long-term goal is for the SWIG library to be a collection of useful
modules that can be used to quickly put together interesting programs.
To contribute new modules send e-mail to beazley@cs.utah.edu and I
will include them here.
