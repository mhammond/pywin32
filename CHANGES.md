Coming in build 312, as yet unreleased
--------------------------------------

## adodbapi

* When `errorhandler` is called, the `errorvalue` argument is now always an `Exception` and the `errortype` is the `type` of that specific `errorvalue` (#2351, @Avasam)

Build 311, released 2025/07/14
------------------------------

* Fix use-after-free in CertDeleteCertificateFromStore (mhammond#2637)
* Better support for COM identifiers with non-ascii characters (mhammond#2632)
* pywin32's own warnings will now refer to the caller, rather than to the internal source of warning itself (mhammond#2594, [@Avasam][Avasam])
* Fixed a regression that broke special `__dunder__` methods with CoClass. (mhammond#1870, mhammond#2493, [@Avasam][Avasam], [@geppi][geppi])
* Fixed `TypeError: cannot unpack non-iterable NoneType object` when registering an axscript client `ScriptItem` (mhammond#2513, [@Avasam][Avasam])

### Release process changes

pywin32 is now released from artifacts created by Github actions, whereas previously they were
created from an environment where certain tools and libraries were located and installed
by hand.

Build 306, released 2023-03-26
------------------------------

* Add GetSystemPowerStatus (mhammond#2010, [@CristiFati][CristiFati])
* Add CascadeWindows (mhammond#1999, [@CristiFati][CristiFati])
* Add win32gui.ResetDC
* Fix leak in win32pdh.GetFormattedCounterArray
* Fix IIS on later python versions (mhammond#2025)
* Fix for service registration code updated in build 305 (mhammond#1985)
* Support for Python 3.6 was dropped, support for later versions was improved.

Build 305, released 2022-11-06
------------------------------

* Installation .exe files were deprecated.
* [@kxrob][kxrob] put a lot of work towards removing use of the deprecated Unicode
  API so we can build on Python 3.12. This should be largely invisible, but
  please report any unintended consequences.
* odbc: Handle `varchar(max)`/`nvarchar(max)` column sizes (mhammond#1954)
* win32api.GetTickCount() now returns an unsigned 64bit integer ([@kxrob][kxrob], mhammond#1946)
* win32pipe.GetNamedPipeHandleState() now takes a 3rd optional param
  indicating whether the username should be returned, and related constants
  added. ([@kxrob][kxrob], mhammond#1946)
* Add win32gui.GetTopWindow() and win32gui.GetAncestor() (mhammond#1928, [@CristiFati][CristiFati])
* Tweaks to how pywintypes searches for DLLs to better support virtualenvs
  created with --system-site-packages. ([@saaketp][saaketp], mhammond#1933)
* Added win32event.CreateWaitableTimerExW (mhammond#1945, [@zariiii9003][zariiii9003])
* Changes in PARAM handling. Some functions which returned a WPARAM or LPARAM
  allowed you to return a pointer to a Python buffer object or a PyUnicode.
  These functions now only accept a Python long to be returned. Note that
  this DOES NOT apply to functions with accept WPARAM or LPARAM as arguments,
  only when they are being returned. Impacted functions are `OnNotify`
  handler, LV_ITEM/TV_ITEM objects, PyIContextMenu3::HandleMenuMsg2, and the
  result of a WNDPROC/DLGPROC (mhammond#1927).
* service registration had an overhaul, avoiding a complicated, and ultimately
  unnecessary "single globally registered service runner" concept.
  Now, when registering a service, the host pythonservice.exe runner will be
  copied to `sys.exec_prefix`, along with possibly `pywintypesXX.dll` and run
  from there. (mhammond#1908)
* Dropped support for allowing a bytes object to be passed where a COM BSTR
  is expected - this support was accidental on the path from Python 2 -> 3.
* win32crypt's PyCERTSTORE.CertCloseStore()'s `Flags` argument has been
  deprecated as it is likely to crash the process if
  `CERT_CLOSE_STORE_FORCE_FLAG` is specified. The underlying function is now
  always called with `CERT_CLOSE_STORE_CHECK_FLAG`, and support for this
  param will be dropped at some point in the future.
* Fix a bug where win32crypt.CryptQueryObject() would return a PyCTL_CONTEXT
  object instead of a PyCERT_CONTEXT for base64 encoded certificates (mhammond#1859)
* win32crypt.CryptQueryObject() is now able to return PyCTL_CONTEXT objects.
  This is technically a breaking change as previously it would return the
  address in memory of the object, but this address wasn't practically usable,
  so it's very unlikely anyone relied on this behavior. (mhammond#1859)

Build 304, released 2022-05-02
------------------------------

* Fixed Unicode issues in the `dde` module (mhammond#1861, [@markuskimius][markuskimius] )
* Add `PRINTER_INFO_6` support for Set/GetPrinter (mhammond#1853, [@CristiFati][CristiFati])
* Fixed codepage/mojibake issues when non-ascii characters were included in
  COM exceptions raised by Python apps. This should be invisible, but might
  break any workarounds which were used, such as using specific encodings in
  these strings. (mhammond#1823, mhammond#1833)
* Fixed a bug triggering `win32print.SetJob` to fail due to data type
  (`char*` / `wchar_t*`) mismatch (mhammond#1849, [@CristiFati][CristiFati])
* Fix eventlog initialization (mhammond#1845, mhammond#1846, [@kxrob][kxrob])

Build 303, released 2021-12-20
------------------------------

* Tweaks to how DLLs are loaded and our installation found, which should
  improve virtualenv support and version mismatch issues (mhammond#1787, mhammond#1794)
* Fixed a bug where `win32clipboard.GetClipboardData()` may have returned extra
  data.
* Binary installers for 32-bit 3.10+ are no longer released (mhammond#1805)

Build 302, released 2021-10-11
------------------------------

* Fixed support for unicode as a `win32crypt.CREDENTIAL_ATTRIBUTE.Value`
* Support for Python 3.10, dropped support for Python 3.5 (3.5 security support
  ended 13 Sep 2020)
* Merged win2kras into win32ras. In the unlikely case that anyone is still
  using win2kras, there is a win2kras.py that imports all of win32ras. If you
  import win2kras and it fails with 'you must import win32ras first', then it
  means an old win2kras.pyd exists, which you should remove.
* GitHub branch 'master' was renamed to 'main'.

Build 301, released 2021-05-30
------------------------------

* Fix some confusion on how dynamic COM object properties work. The old
  code was confused, so there's a chance there will be some subtle
  regression here - please open a bug if you find anything, but this
  should fix mhammond#1427.
* COM objects are now registered with the full path to pythoncomXX.dll, fixes
  mhammond#1704.
* Creating a `win32crypt.CRYPT_ATTRIBUTE` object now correctly sets `cbData`.
* Add wrap and unwrap operations defined in the GSSAPI to the sspi module
  and enhance the examples given in this module.
  (mhammond#1692, Emmanuel Coirier)
* Fix a bug in `win32profile.GetEnvironmentStrings()` relating to environment
  variables with an equals sign ([@maxim-krikun][maxim-krikun] in mhammond#1661)
* Fixed a bug where certain COM dates would fail to be converted to a Python
  datetime object with `ValueError: microsecond must be in 0..999999`. Shoutout
  to [@hujiaxing][hujiaxing] for reporting and helping reproduce the issue (mhammond#1655)
* Added win32com.shell.SHGetKnownFolderPath() and related constants.
* CoClass objects should work better with special methods like `__len__` etc.
  (mhammond#1699)
* Shifted work in win32.lib.pywin32_bootstrap to Python's import system from
  manual path manipulations ([@wkschwartz][wkschwartz] in mhammond#1651)
* Fixed a bug where win32print.DeviceCapabilities would return strings
  containing the null character followed by junk characters.
  (mhammond#1654, mhammond#1660, Lincoln Puzey)

Build 300, released 2020-11-14
------------------------------

* Fixed a bug where win32com.client.VARIANT params were returned in the reverse
  order. This only happened when win32com.client.VARIANT was explicitly used
  (ie, not when normal params were passed) For example:

  ```python
      arg1 = VARIANT(pythoncom.VT_R4 | pythoncom.VT_BYREF, 2.0)
      arg2 = VARIANT(pythoncom.VT_BOOL | pythoncom.VT_BYREF, True)
      object.SomeFunction(arg1, arg2)
  ```

  after this call, `arg1.value` was actually the value for `arg2`, and
  vice-versa (mhammond#1303, mhammond#622).

* Fixed a bug that Pythonwin had an empty `sys.argv` ([@kxrob][kxrob] in mhammond#1607)

* Fixed a bug that prevented win32process.ReadProcessMemory() from working
  in all scenarios (mhammond#1599)

* Changed how Services implemented with win32serviceutil.ServiceFramework
  report that they have stopped. Now if the SvcRun() method (or the SvcDoRun()
  method, which is called by SvcRun() by default) raises on Exception,
  the Service will report a final SERVICE_STOPPED status with a non-zero error
  code. This will cause the Service's recovery actions to be triggered if the
  Service has the "Enable actions for stops with errors" option enabled.
  (mhammond#1563, Lincoln Puzey)

* adodbapi connect() method now accepts a "mode" keyword argument which is the
  "Mode" property to set on the ADO "Connection" object before opening the
  Connection. See "ConnectModeEnum" for valid values.
  (Lincoln Puzey)

* The Windows 10 SDK is now used to build the project. This shouldn't cause any
  visible changes, but should make it much easier to build the project yourself.

Python 2 is no longer supported - so long, Python 2, you served us well!

Notable changes in this transition:

* Python 3 builds used to erroneously turn "bytes" into a tuple of integers
  instead of a buffer type object. Because this special-casing is important for
  performance when using massive buffers, this has been fixed in Python 3 so
  it matches the old Python 2 behavior. If you use arrays of VT_UI1 and expect
  get back tuples of integers, your code may break.

* Pythonwin's default encoding is now utf-8 (mhammond#1559)

* The build environment has been greatly simplified - you just need Visual
  Studio and a Windows 10 SDK. (The free compilers probably work too, but
  haven't been tested - let me know your experiences!)
