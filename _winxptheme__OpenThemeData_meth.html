</B>)<P>Open the theme data for the specified HWND and 

semi-colon separated list of class names. 

<BR>OpenThemeData() will try each class name, one at 

a time, and use the first matching theme info 

found.  If a match is found, a theme handle 

to the data is returned.  If no match is found, 

a "NULL" handle is returned. 

<BR>When the window is destroyed or a WM_THEMECHANGED 

msg is received, <A HREF="_winxptheme__CloseThemeData_meth.html">_winxptheme::CloseThemeData</A> should be 

called to close the theme handle.<P>

<DD>Window handle of the control/window to be themed<P><DT><I>pszClassList</I> : string<P>

<DD>Class name (or list of names) to match to theme data 

section.  if the list contains more than one name, 

the names are tested one at a time for a match. 

If a match is found, OpenThemeData() returns a 

theme handle associated with the matching class. 

This param is a list (instead of just a single 

class name) to provide the class an opportunity 

to get the "best" match between the class and 

the current theme.  For example, a button might 

pass L"OkButton, Button" if its ID=ID_OK.  If 

the current theme has an entry for OkButton, 

that will be used.  Otherwise, we fall back on 

the normal Button entry.<P></body>
