The DestroyWindow member function sends appropriate messages 

to the window to deactivate it and remove the input focus. 

It also destroys the window's menu, flushes the application queue, 

destroys outstanding timers, removes Clipboard ownership, and breaks the 

Clipboard-viewer chain if CWnd is at the top of the viewer chain. 

It sends WM_DESTROY and WM_NCDESTROY messages to the window.<P>
