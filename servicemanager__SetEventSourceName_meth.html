<B>SetEventSourceName(<I>sourceName</I><I>, registerNow</I></B>)<P>Sets the event source name 

for event log entries written by the service.<P>

<H3>Parameters</H3><P><DT><I>sourceName</I> : string<P>

<DD>The event source name<P><DT><I>registerNow=False</I> : bool<P>

<DD>If True, the event source name in the 

registry will be updated immediately. 

If False, the name will be registered the first time an event log entry 

is written via any pythonservice methods (or possibly never if no record 

if written). 

<BR>Note that in some cases, the service itself will not have permission 

to write the event source in the registry.  Therefore, it would be 

prudent for your installation program to call this function with 

registerNow=True, to ensure your services can write useful entries.<P>
