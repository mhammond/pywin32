<H2>Introduction </H2>
<P><a href="#KnownProblems">There are a few known problems</a> (and probably
lots of unknown ones!) </P>
<P>Pythonwin is a Windows only IDE and GUI framework for Python.&nbsp; It has an
<a href="doc/debugger/index.html">integrated debugger</a>, and a rich Python
editing environment. </P>
<P>Pythonwin is implemented as a 'wrapper' for the Microsoft Foundation Class library. With it, you can use MFC in an interactive, interpreted environment, or write full blown stand-alone applications tightly coupled with the Windows environment. Over 30 MFC objects are exposed, including Common Controls, Property Pages/Sheets, Control/Toolbars, Threads, etc. </P>
<P>Pythonwin could almost be considered a sample program for the MFC UI environment. This Python UI environment can be embedded in almost any other application - such as OLE clients/servers, as a Macro language etc. </P>
<P><A HREF="#RecentChanges">Recent changes can be found at the end of this document</A>.</P>
<H2>Demos</H2>
<P>There are many demos in the pywin\demos directory. To see a list of all the demos, run the program "pywin\demos\guidemo.py" from inside Pythonwin.</P>
<H2>Documentation </H2>
<P>Almost all win32ui methods are document in the Pythonwin Help file. This is available from the Help Menu in the Pythonwin enviroment.</P>
<P>Below is a list of external Pythonwin specific documentation. </P>

<UL>
<LI>There is separate <a href="doc/debugger/index.html">documentation for the
  debugger</a> </LI>
<LI>Check out documentation on <A HREF="doc/guienvironment.html">the Pythonwin GUI environment</A> </LI>
<LI>For a brief description of how to embed win32ui.pyd into your MFC application see the <A HREF="doc/EmbeddingWin32ui.html">embedding win32ui documentation</A>. </LI>
<LI>There is some general documentation on the <A HREF="doc/architecture.html">MFC Architecture</A> and more specifically, <A HREF="doc/docview.html">document and view architecture</A>. </LI>
<LI>A Reference Manual of all available MFC functions etc. is released as a Windows Help file with the main Pythonwin release. </LI>
<LI>Check out the demos, and the source code to the Pythonwin environment.</LI></UL>

<H2><a name="KnownProblems">Known Problems</a></H2>

<UL>
<LI>Some of the configuration options (eg, &quot;Docking Windows&quot;) do not
  take affect until you restart Pythonwin. </LI>
<LI>Some of the menu items are always grey.&nbsp; This functionality is simply not yet implemented in
  Pythonwin. </LI>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="RecentChanges">Recent Changes</A></H2>
<P>Fixed alot of the interactive window formatting problems.&nbsp; Pythonwin now
always prints output as it receives it - this should stop Pythonwin from looking
like it has completely hung when infact it is just waiting for some code to
finish.</P>
<P>Support for Scintilla's indentation guides, that gives a nice indication of
the block structure.</P>
<P>New, improved color editor, using the Scintilla control by Neil Hodgson (see <A HREF="https://www.scintilla.org/">https://www.scintilla.org/</A>). The debugger now requires use of this editor.</P>
<P>Much better printing support from Roger Burnham. Pythonwin itself still can't print anything, but the framework can (meaning some kind soul could now add the support to Pythonwin :-)</P>
<P>DDE support is complete.</P>
<P>Reference helpfile is far more complete.</P>
<P>Lots of new methods from Kleanthis Kleanthous.</P>
<P>Better tool-tip and region support</P>
