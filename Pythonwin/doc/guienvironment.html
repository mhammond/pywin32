<P>This document describes the Pythonwin GUI environment. There are quite a few little features hidden away! </P>
<P>It has a discussion on the General Environment (including the
   <A HREF="#InteractiveWindow">Interactive Window</A> and <A HREF="#MenuandToolbar">Menu and Toolbar</A>),
   and the <A HREF="#CommandLineArguments">Command Line Arguments</A> supported. </P>

<H2>General Environment </H2>
<H3><A NAME="InteractiveWindow">Interactive Window</A> </H3>
<P>The Interactive Window is a little Python program which simulates the
   built-in Python interpreter. It is implemented in intpyapp.py (which
   in turn uses winout.py - a general purpose "output window".)
</P>
<H4>Pressing Enter </H4>
<P>Whenever you press Enter, the interactive window has a look at
   the context, to try and decide what to do.
</P>
<P>If the line is recognised as a "block" (ie, the first line starts with
   "&gt;&gt;&gt; ", and the rest start with "… "), it checks to see if we
   are at the end of the window. If not, the block is copied to the end of
   the buffer - nothing is executed - enter must be pressed again to force
   execution.
</P>
<P>If we are at the end of the buffer, it <I>always</I> attempts to execute
   the line. If Python indicates "unexpected end of file", then it assumes
   the block should continue, and emits the "… " for the next line.
</P>
<P>If the line is recognised as part of a Python exception, then some special
   processing is done. If the line contains a filename and line number, it
   locates that file, and jumps to the offending line.
</P>
<P>If the line is recognised as being an exception generated by COM (aka OLE),
and the exception contains reference to a WinHelp file, the help topic is
opened.
</P>
<H3><A NAME="MenuandToolbar">Menu and Toolbar</A> </H3>
<H4>File Open/Close/Save/Print/etc. </H4>
<P>All perform the obvious file operations. Pythonwin follows the standard
   MFC framework, and allows Python programs to plug-in support for other file
   types.
</P>
<H4>Locate File </H4>
<P>Allows quick location of a Python scripts. Typing in the base name of a
   file will force a search of all the directories on sys.path, until a match
   is found.
</P>
<P>To locate a module in a package you can use either a (back) slash or a
   dot - eg, to locate "win32com.client.dynamic", you can enter in
   "win32com\client/dynamic"
</P>
<H4>Import Script </H4>
<P>Imports or reloads a script - just like
   "import scriptname"/"reload(scriptname)" - (Pythonwin determines if the
   operation is an import or reload, It also handles "ni" modules with some
   success!)
</P>
<P>If you select this (or use &lt;Ctrl-I&gt;) when a .py file is open, that
   file is saved and imported. If a current file can not be located, it will
   ask for a file to import via a File dialog.
</P>
<P>If a syntax error occurs, the location will be moved to in the editor.
</P>
<H4>Run Script </H4>
<P>Runs a script, as if the file was passed on the command line. A dialog is
   opened, asking the script name and arguments (unless the &lt;Shift&gt; key
   is held down)
</P>
<H2><A NAME="CommandLineArguments">Command Line Arguments</A> </H2>
<P>The following command line arguments are recognised. Note that these are
   implemented in "intpyapp.py", so should be pretty easy to change!
</P>
<H4>/new</H4>
<H4><i>(deprecated)</i>/nodde</H4>
<P>Creates a new instance of the application even if one is already running.
</P>

<H4>/edit filename</H4>
<P>Edit the named file.
</P>

<H4>/run scriptname args </H4>
<P>Runs the named script. Works just like "Python.exe scriptname args", except
   it is run in the GUI environment, and output goes to the interactive
   window.
</P>
<H4>/rundlg scriptname args </H4>
<P>As above, except the normal Pythonwin 'Run Script' dialog is shown. </P>
<H4>/edit filename.py </H4>
<P>Edits the filename. The /edit is currently optional, but in the future,
   the "default argument handling" may be changed.
</P>
<H4>/app specialscriptname args </H4>
<P>Runs a special "application script". The application script can change the
  entire look and feel of a Pythonwin program - almost as much flexibility as
  the C++ programmer has when they first start their application). An example
  of this is "dlgapp.py" in the Pythonwin distribution.
</P>
