README for building of Scintilla and SciTE

Scintilla can be built by itself.
To build SciTE, Scintilla must first be built.


*** GTK+/Linux version ***

You must first have GTK+ 1.2 or later and GCC (3.1 or better) installed.
GTK+ 1.0x will not work and when it did it was very slow.
Other C++ compilers may work but may require tweaking the make file.

To build Scintilla, use the makefile located in the scintilla/gtk directory
	cd scintilla/gtk
	make
	cd ../..

To build and install SciTE, use the makefile located in the scite/gtk directory
	cd scite/gtk
	make
	make install

This installs SciTE into $prefix/bin. The value of $prefix is determined from
the location of Gnome if it is installed. This is usually /usr if installed
with Linux or /usr/local if built from source. If Gnome is not installed
/usr/bin is used as the prefix. The prefix can be overridden on the command
line like "make prefix=/opt" but the same value should be used for both make
and make install as this location is compiled into the executable. The global
properties file is installed at $prefix/share/scite/SciTEGlobal.properties.
The language specific properties files are also installed into this directory.

To build Scintilla for GTK+ 1 rather than the default GTK+ 2, define GTK1 on
the make command line:
	make GTK1=1

To remove SciTE
	make uninstall

To clean the object files which may be needed to change $prefix
	make clean

The current make file only supports static linking between SciTE and Scintilla.


*** Windows version ***

A C++ compiler is required. Visual Studio .NET 2008 is the development system
used for most development although Mingw32 3.1 is also supported.
Borland did work but the command lines are now too long and the most recent
Borland version does not work. For older versions such as version 5.02, add the -l option.

To build Scintilla, make in the scintilla/win32 directory
		cd scintilla\win32
GCC:		mingw32-make
VS .NET:	nmake -f scintilla.mak
VC++ 6:	nmake -f scintilla_vc6.mak
Borland: 	make -fscintilla.mak
		cd ..\..

To build SciTE, use the makefiles located in the scite/win32 directory
		cd scite\win32
GCC:		mingw32-make
VS .NET: 	nmake -f scite.mak
Borland:	make -fscite.mak

An executable SciTE will now be in scite\bin.

The Visual C++ 6.0 project (.dsp) files are no longer supported but are left
in the download for people that are prepared to update them.
