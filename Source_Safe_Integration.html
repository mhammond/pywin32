Note you will need to restart Pythonwin for this option to take effect.<P>

Before using the VSS integration, you must create a "mssccprj.scc" file 

in the directory, or a parent directory, of the files you wish to 

integrate. There are no limits on how many of these files exist. This is 

the same name and format as VB uses for VSS integration - a Windows INI 

file.<P>

This file must have a section [Python] with entry "Project=ProjectName". 

The project name is the name of the VSS project used to check the out 

the file. If the .scc file is in a parent directory, the correct 

relative VSS path is built - so if your file system matches your VSS 

structure, you only need a single .scc file in the VSS "root" directory.<P>

<BR>For example, assuming you have the file c:\\src\\mssccprj.scc with the contents: 

<BR>[Python] 

<BR>Project=OurProject 

<BR>-eof- 

<BR>The file c:\\src\\source1.py will be checked out from project OurProject, 

c:\\src\\sub\\source2.py will be checked out from project OurProject\\sub, 

etc.<P>
