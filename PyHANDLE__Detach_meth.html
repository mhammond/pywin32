<H3>Comments</H3>

After calling this function, the handle is effectively invalidated, 

but the handle is not closed.  You would call this function when you 

need the underlying win32 handle to exist beyond the lifetime of the 

handle object.<P>

<H3>Return Value</H3>The result is the value of the handle before it is detached.  If the 

handle is already detached, this will return zero.<P>
