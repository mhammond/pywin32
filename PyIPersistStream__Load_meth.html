This method loads an object from its associated stream. The seek pointer is set as it was in the most 

recent <A HREF="PyIPersistStream__Save_meth.html">PyIPersistStream::Save</A> method. This method can seek and read from the stream, but cannot write to it.<P>

On exit, the seek pointer must be in the same position it was in on entry, immediately past the end of the 

data.<P>
