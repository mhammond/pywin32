&#09def Resolve(self, window, flags):

&#09&#09'''Resolves a shell link by searching for the shell link object and updating the

&#09&#09shell link path and its list of identifiers (if necessary).

&#09&#09Notes:

&#09&#09&#09window is the parent window of a dialog which will pop up if resolution fails

&#09&#09flags:

&#09&#09&#09SLR_INVOKE_MSI  Call the Microsoft Windows Installer.

&#09&#09&#09SLR_NOLINKINFO  Disable distributed link tracking. By default, distributed

&#09&#09&#09&#09link tracking tracks removable media across multiple devices based on the

&#09&#09&#09&#09volume name. It also uses the UNC path to track remote file systems whose

&#09&#09&#09&#09drive letter has changed. Setting SLR_NOLINKINFO disables both types of tracking.

&#09&#09&#09SLR_NO_UI       Do not display a dialog box if the link cannot be resolved. When

&#09&#09&#09&#09SLR_NO_UI is set, the high-order word of fFlags can be set to a time-out value

&#09&#09&#09&#09that specifies the maximum amount of time to be spent resolving the link. The

&#09&#09&#09&#09function returns if the link cannot be resolved within the time-out duration.

&#09&#09&#09&#09If the high-order word is set to zero, the time-out duration will be set to the

&#09&#09&#09&#09default value of 3,000 milliseconds (3 seconds). To specify a value, set the high

&#09&#09&#09&#09word of fFlags to the desired time-out duration, in milliseconds.

&#09&#09&#09SLR_NOUPDATE    Do not update the link information.

&#09&#09&#09SLR_NOSEARCH    Do not execute the search heuristics.

&#09&#09&#09SLR_NOTRACK     Do not use distributed link tracking.

&#09&#09&#09SLR_UPDATE      If the link object has changed, update its path and list of identifiers. If SLR_UPDATE is set, you do not need to call IPersistFile::IsDirty to determine whether or not the link object has changed.

&#09### Problematic elements

&#09# The problems below are due primarily to structs used in the API

&#09def GetIDList(self):

&#09&#09'''Retrieves the list of item identifiers for a shell link object.

&#09&#09Note: I do not see how to manipulate these identifiers, they are C structs,

&#09&#09so I suppose we might be able to unpack them with the struct module.

&#09&#09However, when I attempt this, I seem to get messed up identifiers

&#09&#09(lengths of 0 for the individual identifiers) (see malfunctioning code below)'''

&#09def SetIDList(self, IDList):

&#09&#09'''Sets the list of item identifiers for a shell link object.

&#09&#09Note: See comments on GetIDList'''

&#09def SetHotkey(self, Hotkey):

&#09&#09'''Sets the hot key for a shell link object.

&#09&#09Note: New hot key. The virtual key code is in the low-order byte, and the modifier

&#09&#09flags are in the high-order byte. The modifier flags can be a combination of the

&#09&#09values specified in the description of the IShellLink::GetHotkey method.

&#09&#09Note: I cannot find these constants anywhere...

&#09&#09&#09HOTKEYF_ALT, HOTKEYF_CONTROL, HOTKEYF_EXT, HOTKEYF_SHIFT

&#09&#09'''

&#09def GetHotkey (self):

&#09&#09'''Retrieves the hot key for a shell link object.

&#09&#09Note: My tests do not seem to be working. at least, the values returned

&#09&#09seem not to match what the documentation says should be returned.

&#09&#09I would expect with a Hotkey of CTRL-ALT-T, to get an integer where

&#09&#09integer & 256 == ord('T'), i.e. 116 or 84, instead I get 1620
