<HR><H1>PyOVERLAPPED Object</H1><P>

A Python object, representing an overlapped structure<P>

<H3>Comments</H3>

Typically you create a PyOVERLAPPED object, and set its hEvent property. 

The object can then be passed to any function which takes an OVERLAPPED object, and 

the object attributes will be automatically updated.<P>

<H3>Properties</H3>

<DL>

<DT><B>integer Offset</B>

<DD>Specifies a file position at which to start the transfer. The 

file position is a byte offset from the start of the file. The calling process sets 

this member before calling the ReadFile&#160or WriteFile function. This member is 

ignored when reading from or writing to named pipes and communications devices.<P>



<DT><B>integer OffsetHigh</B>

<DD>Specifies the high word of the 

byte offset at which to start the transfer.<P>



<DT><B>object object</B>

<DD>Any python object that you want to attach 

to your overlapped I/O request.<P>



<DT><B>int dword</B>

<DD>An integer buffer that may be used by overlapped 

functions (eg, <A HREF="win32file__WaitCommEvent_meth.html">win32file::WaitCommEvent</A>)<P>



<DT><B><A HREF="PyHANDLE.html">PyHANDLE</A> hEvent</B>

<DD>Identifies an event set to the signaled state when 

the transfer has been completed. The calling process sets this member before 

calling the <A HREF="win32file__ReadFile_meth.html">win32file::ReadFile</A>, <A HREF="win32file__WriteFile_meth.html">win32file::WriteFile</A>, <A HREF="win32pipe__ConnectNamedPipe_meth.html">win32pipe::ConnectNamedPipe</A>, or <A HREF="win32pipe__TransactNamedPipe_meth.html">win32pipe::TransactNamedPipe</A>&#160function.<P>



<DT><B>integer Internal</B>

<DD>Reserved for operating system use. (pointer-sized value)<P>
