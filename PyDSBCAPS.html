<TR><TD><HR></TD><TD><HR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>DSBCAPS_PRIMARYBUFFER</TD><TD>Indicates that the buffer is a 

primary sound buffer. If this value is not specified, a 

secondary sound buffer will be created.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>DSBCAPS_STATIC</TD><TD>Indicates that the buffer will be used 

for static sound data. Typically, these buffers are loaded 

once and played many times. These buffers are candidates for 

hardware memory.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>DSBCAPS_LOCHARDWARE</TD><TD>The buffer is in hardware memory 

and uses hardware mixing.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>DSBCAPS_LOCSOFTWARE</TD><TD>The buffer is in software memory 

and uses software mixing.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>DSBCAPS_CTRL3D</TD><TD>The buffer is either a primary buffer 

or a secondary buffer that uses 3-D control. To create a 

primary buffer, the dwFlags member of the DSBUFFERDESC 

structure should include the DSBCAPS_PRIMARYBUFFER flag.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>DSBCAPS_CTRLFREQUENCY</TD><TD>The buffer must have frequency 

control capability.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>DSBCAPS_CTRLPAN</TD><TD>The buffer must have pan control 

capability.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>DSBCAPS_CTRLVOLUME</TD><TD>The buffer must have volume control 

capability.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>DSBCAPS_CTRLPOSITIONNOTIFY</TD><TD>The buffer must have 

control position notify capability.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>DSBCAPS_STICKYFOCUS</TD><TD>Changes the focus behavior of the 

sound buffer. This flag can be specified in an 

IDirectSound::CreateSoundBuffer call. With this flag set, an 

application using DirectSound can continue to play its 

sticky focus buffers if the user switches to another 

application not using DirectSound. In this situation, the 

application's normal buffers are muted, but the sticky focus 

buffers are still audible. This is useful for nongame 

applications, such as movie playback (DirectShow&#153), when the 

user wants to hear the soundtrack while typing in Microsoft 

Word or Microsoft&#174 Excel, for example. However, if the user 

switches to another DirectSound application, all sound 

buffers, both normal and sticky focus, in the previous 

application are muted.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>DSBCAPS_GLOBALFOCUS</TD><TD>The buffer is a global sound 

buffer. With this flag set, an application using DirectSound 

can continue to play its buffers if the user switches focus 

to another application, even if the new application uses 

DirectSound. The one exception is if you switch focus to a 

DirectSound application that uses the DSSCL_EXCLUSIVE or 

DSSCL_WRITEPRIMARY flag for its cooperative level. In this 

case, the global sounds from other applications will not be 

audible.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>DSBCAPS_GETCURRENTPOSITION2</TD><TD>Indicates that 

IDirectSoundBuffer::GetCurrentPosition should use the new 

behavior of the play cursor. In DirectSound in DirectX 1, 

the play cursor was significantly ahead of the actual 

playing sound on emulated sound cards; it was directly 

behind the write cursor. Now, if the 

DSBCAPS_GETCURRENTPOSITION2 flag is specified, the 

application can get a more accurate play position. If this 

flag is not specified, the old behavior is preserved for 

compatibility. Note that this flag affects only emulated 

sound cards; if a DirectSound driver is present, the play 

cursor is accurate for DirectSound in all versions of 

DirectX.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>DSBCAPS_MUTE3DATMAXDISTANCE</TD><TD>The sound is reduced to 

silence at the maximum distance. The buffer will stop 

playing when the maximum distance is exceeded, so that 

processor time is not wasted.</TD></TR>

</TABLE><DT><B>integer nChannels</B>

<DD>Size of the buffer, in bytes.<P>



<DT><B>integer dwUnlockTransferRate</B>

<DD>Specifies the rate, in kilobytes per second, at which data is transferred to 

the buffer memory when IDirectSoundBuffer::Unlock is called. High-performance applications can use this value to 

determine the time required for IDirectSoundBuffer::Unlock to execute. For software buffers located in system 

memory, the rate will be very high because no processing is required. For hardware buffers, the rate might be 

slower because the buffer might have to be downloaded to the sound card, which might have a limited transfer 

rate.<P>



<DT><B>integer nAvgBytesPerSec</B>

<DD>Specifies whether the returned handle is 

inherited when a new process is created. If this member is TRUE, the new 

process inherits the handle.
