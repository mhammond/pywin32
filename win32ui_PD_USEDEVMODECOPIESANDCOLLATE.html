This flag indicates whether 

your application supports multiple copies and collation. Set this flag on 

input to indicate that your application does not support multiple copies and 

collation. In this case, the nCopies member of the PRINTDLG structure always 

returns 1, and PD_COLLATE is never set in the Flags member. If this flag is 

not set, the application is responsible for printing and collating multiple 

copies. In this case, the nCopies member of the PRINTDLG structure indicates 

the number of copies the user wants to print, and the PD_COLLATE flag in the 

Flags member indicates whether the user wants collation. Regardless of 

whether this flag is set, an application can determine from nCopies and 

PD_COLLATE how many copies to render and whether to print them collated.  If 

this flag is set and the printer driver does not support multiple copies, 

the Copies edit control is disabled. Similarly, if this flag is set and the 

printer driver does not support collation, the Collate checkbox is disabled. 

The dmCopies and dmCollate members of theDEVMODE structure contain the 

copies and collate information used by the printer driver. If this flag is 

set and the printer driver supports multiple copies, the dmCopies member 

indicates the number of copies requested by the user. If this flag is set 

and the printer driver supports collation, the dmCollate member of the 

DEVMODE structure indicates whether the user wants collation. If this flag 

is not set, the dmCopies member always returns 1, and the dmCollate member 

is always zero.<P>
