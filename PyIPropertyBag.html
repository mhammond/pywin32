A Python wrapper for a COM IPropertyBag interface.<P>

<H3>Comments</H3>

The IPropertyBag interface provides an object with a property bag in which the object can persistently save its 

properties.<BR> When a client wishes to have exact control over how individually named properties of an object are 

saved, it would attempt to use an object's IPersistPropertyBag interface as a persistence mechanism. In that case the 

client supplies a property bag to the object in the form of an IPropertyBag interface.<P>
