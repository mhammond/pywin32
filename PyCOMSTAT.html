<DL>

<DT><B>integer cbInQue</B>

<DD>Specifies the number of bytes received by the serial provider 

but not yet read by a <A HREF="win32file__ReadFile_meth.html">win32file::ReadFile</A> operation<P>



<DT><B>integer cbOutQue</B>

<DD>Specifies the number of bytes of user data 

remaining to be transmitted for all write operations. This value 

will be zero for a nonoverlapped write.<P>



<DT><B>integer fCtsHold</B>

<DD>Specifies whether transmission is waiting for the CTS (clear-to-send) signal to be sent. If 

this member is TRUE, transmission is waiting.<P>



<DT><B>integer fDsrHold</B>

<DD>Specifies whether transmission is waiting for the DSR (data-set-ready) signal to be sent. If 

this member is TRUE, transmission is waiting.<P>



<DT><B>integer fRlsdHold</B>

<DD>Specifies whether transmission is waiting for the RLSD (receive-line-signal-detect) signal to 

be sent. If this member is TRUE, transmission is waiting.<P>



<DT><B>integer fXoffHold</B>

<DD>Specifies whether transmission is waiting because the XOFF character was received. If this 

member is TRUE, transmission is waiting.<P>



<DT><B>integer fXoffSent</B>

<DD>Specifies whether transmission is waiting because the XOFF character was transmitted. If this 

member is TRUE, transmission is waiting. Transmission halts when the XOFF character is transmitted to a system that 

takes the next character as XON, regardless of the actual character.<P>



<DT><B>integer fEof</B>

<DD>Specifies whether the end-of-file (EOF) character has been received. If this member is TRUE, the 

EOF character has been received.<P>



<DT><B>integer fTxim</B>

<DD>If this member is TRUE, there is a character queued for transmission that has come to the 

communications device by way of the TransmitCommChar function. The communications device transmits such a character 

ahead of other characters in the device's output buffer.<P>



<DT><B>integer fReserved</B>

<DD>Reserved; do not use.<P>
