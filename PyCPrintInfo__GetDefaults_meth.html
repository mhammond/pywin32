<B>GetDefaults(</B>)<P>Nonzero if the function was successful; otherwise 0.  Call this function to 

retrieve the device defaults of the default printer without displaying a dialog box. The retrieved values are placed 

in the m_pd structure.  In some cases, a call to this function will call the constructor for CPrintDialog with 

bPrintSetupOnly set to FALSE. In these cases, a printer DC and hDevNames and hDevMode (two handles located in the 

m_pd data member) are automatically allocated.  If the constructor for CPrintDialog was called with bPrintSetupOnly 

set to FALSE, this function will not only return hDevNames and hDevMode (located in m_pd.hDevNames and m_pd.hDevMode) 

to the caller, but will also return a printer DC in m_pd.hDC. It is the responsibility of the caller to delete the 

printer DC and call the WindowsGlobalFree function on the handles when you are finished with the CPrintDialog object.<P>
