<TR><TD>DSSCL_NORMAL</TD><TD>Sets the application to a fully cooperative status. Most applications should use this 

level, because it has the smoothest multitasking and resource-sharing behavior.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>DSSCL_PRIORITY</TD><TD>Sets the application to the priority level. Applications with this cooperative level can 

call the DirectSoundBuffer.setFormat and DirectSound.compact methods.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>DSSCL_EXCLUSIVE</TD><TD>Sets the application to the exclusive level. When it has the input focus, the 

application will be the only one audible (sounds from applications with the DSBCAPS_GLOBALFOCUS flag set will 

be muted). With this level, it also has all the privileges of the DSSCL_PRIORITY level. DirectSound will 

restore the hardware format, as specified by the most recent call to the DirectSoundBuffer.setFormat method, 

once the application gains the input focus. (Note that DirectSound will always restore the wave format, no 

matter what priority level is set.)</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>DSSCL_WRITEPRIMARY</TD><TD>This is the highest priority level. The application has write access to the primary 

sound buffers. No secondary sound buffers in any application can be played.</TD></TR>
